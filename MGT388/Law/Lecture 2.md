#### Five components of a contract

- offer

  - An offer is a statement of the terms on which the offeror is willing to be bound. It is the present contractual intent to be bound by a contract with **definite and certain** terms communicated to the offeree.
  - Offers may be presented in a letter, newspaper advertisement, fax, email verbally or even conduct, as long as it communicates the basis on which the offeror is prepared to contract.

- Acceptance

  - Acceptance is final and unqualified assent to an offer which must correspond exactly with the offer, with no variation of the terms. If, as in this case, a purported acceptance does not match the terms of the offer, then no contract is formed and, instead, a counter-offer is made.

    - For example, when you list an item on eBay with a “buy now” price, with an option to sell it for the best offer, every bid placed on your item constitutes a counteroffer. If you accept a counteroffer, this becomes the basis of the contract of sale

  - •An offer may terminated at any point up until acceptance (Routledge v Grant)

    •

    •An offer will lapse after a ‘reasonable’ time

    •

    •An offer will lapse on the failure of a condition precedent

    •

    •An offer will lapse on the death of the offerer…. maybe!

- Consideration

  - 对价（consideration）原本是英美合同法中的重要概念，其内涵是一方为换取另一方做某事的承诺而向另一方支付的金钱代价或得到该种承诺的代价。指当事人一方在获得某种利益时，必须给付对方相应的代价

  - past consideration:

    - 过去的对价；以往的对价 合同订立前已完成的行为一般不能作为允诺的对价，因为这不是对新允诺的交换，过去的对价对要约人无益，对受约人也无损，但也有例外，如对已逾时效的旧债或已经破产程序解除的债务作出同意还债的新允诺。 

      •An exception to the requirement for consideration are contracts by deed (a document made under seal)

      •If a gift is made within a deed, it may be enforceable as what is known as a *speciality* (as opposed to a *simple*) contract 

      Contracts by deed are rare and very much the exception



Implied term

An implied term is **a term that hasn't been agreed expressly by either party**, but that has been implied by the other terms of the contract.
