### How a contract can be discharged

- Performance of contract (contract completed)
- By mutual agreement of contractual parties
- Breach of contract (contract is voidable if certain terms breached.
  - A breach of contract occurs when one party in a binding agreement fails to deliver according to the terms of the agreement.
  - A breach of contract can happen in both a written and an oral contract.
  - The parties involved in a breach of contract may resolve the issue among themselves, or in a court of law.
  - There are different types of contract breaches, including a minor or material breach and an actual or anticipatory breach.
- Frustration of contract (remaining contractual duties are discharged)(**无法履行**)
  - Frustration applies **where an unforeseen event makes performance of the contract impossible**. If a contract is frustrated it effectively comes to an end and the parties are released from their obligations. 
- Improper conduct (contract is voidable)





### Breach

#### Repudiatory breach（否认性毁约）

Examples of repudiatory breaches include [*renunciation*](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/5-559-4767?documentSection=co_anchor_a551772) of the contract (a clear refusal to perform obligations); breach of a [*condition*](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/9-107-5976); or a sufficiently serious breach of an [*intermediate term*](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/0-107-6720) (that is, neither a condition nor a [*warranty*](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/6-107-7496)).



### Anticipatory breach（在到期之前，说明无法按时履行合约）

If one party indicates that it will not/cannot perform obligation in advance, the other party can choose to terminate.

for example: “**A” contracts to sell crops to “B” within a due date**, however before the due date he gives a written application to “B” saying, “ I'll not deliver the crops as promised”). When it comes to repudiation, sometimes action makes it impossible for the other party to perform.



### Remedies

- Claim for a debt (a claim for the ‘work’ already done under the contract)

- Specific performance（法院会强制执行某些事情）: Specific performance is a type of remedy for breach of contract in which a court orders the breaching party to perform their end of the bargain.

- Injunction（禁令，法院命令禁止不允许做一些事情）: Injunctions serve a similar purpose as specific performance. The difference is that with specific performance, the court orders a party to do something. With an injunction, the court often orders a party not to do something

- Rescission（撤销合同，法院可以规定恢复到签订合同之前的状态）

  - Rescission allows a non-breaching party to cancel the contract as a remedy for a breach. Rather than seeking monetary damages, the non-breaching party can simply refuse to complete their end of the bargain. Rescission puts the parties back in the position they would have been in had they never entered into the contract.

  - Rescission is the voiding of a contract by a court that does not recognize it as legally binding.

  - Courts can free non-liable parties from their obligations in a contract.

  - Rescission can occur when there is a material error in the contract, evidence of fraud, a lack of legal or mental capacity, or other applicable circumstances.

  - Many states offer rescission on various business-to-consumer (B2C) contracts.

  - However, to justify rescission, the breach must be material. That means that it has to go to the heart of the contractual agreement.

    For example, imagine that you contract to provide catering services for an event. The contract requires the other party to pay half the contract price by a certain date, but they never pay.

    Since payment goes to the heart of the contract, you would be justified in rescinding the contract and refusing to provide the catering services.

- Damage(违约金)



### Type of Damages

- Punitive/exemplary damages(交罚款，法院裁定他们赔偿并不是为了赔偿原告，而是为了示范性赔偿)
  - Punitive damages are also called “exemplary damages,” which are damages assessed in the legal process to punish a defendant for negligence. ... Individuals can also be ordered to pay punitive damages that injure someone else due to negligent behavior. Examples of this would be **drunk driving or distracted driving**.
  - not available for breach of contract 
- Restitutory damages（为了让原告，受害者，收到赔偿并恢复到原来的位置，很少见）
  - Restitution is often calculated by evaluating the gains of the defendant. The defendant is required to give up any gains they obtained illegally to the plaintiff. The goal is to put the injured party back in the same position they were in before suffering the damages at the fault of the defendant.
  - Possible but highly exceptional and will only be awarded if other remedies are inadequate and claimant has a legitimate interest in depriving the defendant of his profit (*AG v Blake*)
- Compensatory damages
  - Compensatory damages, as the name indicates, are **intended to compensate a claimant for losses suffered as a result of the other party's (wrongful) conduct**. Those losses can be pecuniary (e.g., costs, loss of profit, related expenses) or non-pecuniary (e.g., for pain and suffering, loss of reputation).
  - Aim is to put wronged party in position they would have been in had contract been performed/completed



### What can claimant be compensated for

•Cost of replacement performance 

•Lost profits

•Damage to property

•Personal injury

•Damages payable to customer

•Damage to commercial reputation

•Emotional distress

•Loss of pleasure



### Limitation on compensation(并不是可以随意就可以获取补偿的，是有条件的)

- Mitigation(duty of claimant to mitigate his/her loss resulting from breach,假如本身是可以缓解损失，而没有去执行，将无法获得补偿)
  - The concept is a limitation on damages in law. So there can be no recovery if the nonbreaching party had an opportunity to avoid or limit losses and failed to take advantage of it. Such an opportunity exists as long as it does not impose, in the Restatement’s words, an “undue risk, burden or humiliation
- Non-pecuniary losses: Non pecuniary losses can be characterized as **losses that are suffered by damaging goods or interests** which have in themselves no economic price or value on a financial market.
- **Example:** Non-pecuniary losses generally include pain and suffering and loss of **amenity and mental distress.**
- Liquidated damages（违约金）:enforceable
- penalty clauses(罚金条款，在英国通常不可执行)：Broadly, a penalty clause is a contractual provision which levies an excessive monetary sum unrelated to the actual harm against a defaulting party. Penalty clauses are generally **unenforceable under English law**。
- Remoteness(造成的损失，必须直接或者大概率是由毁约造成的，才能进行索赔)
  - Loss must occur naturally or as a result of the usual course of things after a breach OR
  - Loss was in reasonable contemplation of both of the parties at the time contract was entered into



### Frustration of contract(不可抗力的事使合同失效)

Frustration applies **where an unforeseen event makes performance of the contract impossible**. If a contract is frustrated it effectively comes to an end and the parties are released from their obligations. 

**Example**:

For example, **I agree to sell you my house, but then my house burns down**. The non-availability of a party, due to death, illness, or other exceptional circumstances. For example, you hire a famous band to play at a party, but the lead singer is taken ill and can't perform.

•Impossibility

•Illegality

•Frustration of purpose

•Impracticability (but must be extreme)



**Effect**

- Has effect of extinguishing all remaining obligations under the contract (Sections 1(2) and 1(3) of Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943)
- •Resulted in increased use of force majeure clauses(不可抗力条款)





### Voidable contract due to improper conduct

- Misrepresentation（在签合同时，做出不实陈述，诱导签约人）

  - In contract law, misrepresentation involves: **An untruth – A statement made by one contracting party** (the representor) to another which isn't true and. Inducement– As a result of the statement the other contracting party (the representee) is encouraged to enter into the contract and relies on the statement

    **Example**

     A false statement can be an action also. Example: **if I hide some damp in a house I am trying to let and I tell the person viewing the house that there is no damp (Gordon Selico)**

- Duress & Economic Duress(经济胁迫，签约人除了接受签约别无选择，多发生在金钱纠纷，或者暴力胁迫，但双方本身可能并无直接的特殊关系。）

  What is economic duress? Economic duress **in contract occurs**, for example, where a party to a contract (A) threatens to cancel the contract unless the other party (B) agrees to their demands and B has no other practical option but to agree to the new terms of the contract.

- Undue influence(总而言之，也是胁迫的意味，比如公司老板胁迫员工签订某合约，否则就开除等等，多发生在双方是有特殊关系上的，比如 雇员与雇主 父母与子女 老婆和丈夫))

  - Undue influence occurs **when an individual is able to persuade another's decisions due to the relationship between the two parties**. ... The more powerful individual uses this advantage to coerce the other individual into making decisions that might not be in their long-term best interest.

    **Example**

    For example, **a husband persuading his wife to guarantee his company's overdraft with a bank**, using the matrimonial home, of which she is joint owner, as security for the debt. In such situations the creditor may be 'tainted' by the undue influence of the intermediary.

    

    The person is being forced to do something against his will. The injured person can use this pressure tactic as a basis to void the contract. An example is when **an employee of a real estate company is threatened with his job unless he signs a contract agreeing to unreasonable terms in a real estate transaction**.
