### How a contract can be discharged

- Performance of contract (contract completed)
- By mutual agreement of contractual parties
- Breach of contract (contract is voidable if certain terms breached.
  - A breach of contract occurs when one party in a binding agreement fails to deliver according to the terms of the agreement.
  - A breach of contract can happen in both a written and an oral contract.
  - The parties involved in a breach of contract may resolve the issue among themselves, or in a court of law.
  - There are different types of contract breaches, including a minor or material breach and an actual or anticipatory breach.
- Frustration of contract (remaining contractual duties are discharged)(**无法履行**)
  - Frustration applies **where an unforeseen event makes performance of the contract impossible**. If a contract is frustrated it effectively comes to an end and the parties are released from their obligations. 
- Improper conduct (contract is voidable)





### Breach

#### Repudiatory breach

Examples of repudiatory breaches include [*renunciation*](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/5-559-4767?documentSection=co_anchor_a551772) of the contract (a clear refusal to perform obligations); breach of a [*condition*](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/9-107-5976); or a sufficiently serious breach of an [*intermediate term*](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/0-107-6720) (that is, neither a condition nor a [*warranty*](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/6-107-7496)).



### Anticipatory breach

If one party indicates that it will not/cannot perform obligation in advance, the other party can choose to terminate.

for example: “**A” contracts to sell crops to “B” within a due date**, however before the due date he gives a written application to “B” saying, “ I'll not deliver the crops as promised”). When it comes to repudiation, sometimes action makes it impossible for the other party to perform.



### Remedies

- Claim for a debt (a claim for the ‘work’ already done under the contract)

- Specific performance: Specific performance is a type of remedy for breach of contract in which a court orders the breaching party to perform their end of the bargain.

- Injunction: Injunctions serve a similar purpose as specific performance. The difference is that with specific performance, the court orders a party to do something. With an injunction, the court often orders a party not to do something

- Rescission

  - Rescission allows a nonbreaching party to cancel the contract as a remedy for a breach. Rather than seeking monetary damages, the nonbreaching party can simply refuse to complete their end of the bargain. Rescission puts the parties back in the position they would have been in had they never entered into the contract.

  - However, to justify rescission, the breach must be material. That means that it has to go to the heart of the contractual agreement.

    For example, imagine that you contract to provide catering services for an event. The contract requires the other party to pay half the contract price by a certain date, but they never pay.

    Since payment goes to the heart of the contract, you would be justified in rescinding the contract and refusing to provide the catering services.

- Damage(违约金)
