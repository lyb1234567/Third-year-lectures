where  $\lambda$ is the half Pitch length. When scaling there are some components which will be changed:

- Area                    $\rightarrow \frac{1}{s^{2}}$
- Speed                  $\rightarrow \frac{1}{s^{2}}$
- Capacitance        $\rightarrow \frac{1}{s}$
- Resistance            $\rightarrow {s}$
- RC                          $\rightarrow {1}$

where C=$\frac{\varepsilon A}{t}$,where t is thickness and C is capacitance. Technically, the equation of Capacitance is
$$
C=&\frac{\varepsilon_{0}\varepsilon_{r}LW}{t}\\
E=&tV\\
Q=&CV
$$


### Gate Oxide

- Scaling of dimensions is generally accompanied by scaling the oxide thickness(to keep field strengths within limits)
- Thinner oxides means increased tunnelling
