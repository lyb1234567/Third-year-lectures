##### Resistance at Each Node

So, for a pull down network, each transistor has resistance:$\frac{R_{o}}{m}$

and for a pull up network, each transistor has resistance:$\frac{2R_{o}}{m}$ the factor **2** is because $\mu _{H}=0.5 \mu_{E}$

 where m is the **width** of each transistor and $R_{o}$ will be 
$$
R_{o}=\frac{2L_{min}}{\mu C_{Ox}W_{min}(V_{DD}-V_{T})}
$$
