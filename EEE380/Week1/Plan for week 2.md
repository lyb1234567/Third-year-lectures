### Requirement

- establish  a basic understanding of some background theory(EEE224 EEE 339)
- Set up basic Matlab technical environment
- It is enough to replicate an experiment mentioned in a certain paper(better improve existing design)
- simulation based
- If i can identify any errors of some papers it can also be thought of as a contribution to the whole 3rd year project.





### What to do

- Background knowledge:EEE224, EEE339
- Matlab( learn to use **help, look for**, maybe no need to use any certain tool boxes)
- search for some of Professor Xiao li 's papers or some papers from **IEEE Xplore,IEEE transaction**, and send them to Xiao li's email.





### Xiao li's research interests

- Back scatter
- Wi-fi: How to use Wi-fi specturem
- block chain
- Meta learning(I will probably work on that later)





### Something to remember

- Xiao li's paper can be searched either through Google scholar or University profile website
- Paper should be after 2018(to make sure it is a latest paper and research)
- Remember that  Transaction and  journal are  more reliable than a conference paper
