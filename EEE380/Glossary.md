### Glossary

- Cellular network:  A **cellular network** or **mobile network** is a [communication network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_network) where the link to and from end nodes is [wireless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless). The network is distributed over land areas called "cells", each served by at least one fixed-location [transceiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transceiver) (typically three [cell sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_site) or [base transceiver stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_transceiver_station)).

- SWIPT:  SWIPT is **a wireless communication technique through which** it is possible to receive information and harvest energy from a received signal, and the harvested energy can be utilized for relaying of information or processing purposes.

- **Device-to-Device (D2D)** communication in cellular networks is defined as direct communication between two mobile users without traversing the [Base Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station) (BS) or [core network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_network).

- user-equipment: like mobile phone, lap top etc..

- Resource block: In 5G, One NR Resource Block (RB) **contains 12 sub-carriers in frequency domain similar to LTE**. 

- circuit sensitivity: A simple definition of circuit sensitivity is **how much a circuit characteristic changes when a component value is different**.
