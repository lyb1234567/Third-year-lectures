Still working on the paper ***Resource and Power Allocation in SWIPT-Enabled Device-to-Device Communications Based on a Nonlinear Energy Harvesting Model***. Record some notes for the piecewise linear EH model mentioned in this paper, and methods for transforming the linear programming model into nonlinear programming model.

### Technical term

- **Piecewise linear functions**

  It is a  function whose graph consists of straight line segments. it is a function of which the each piecewise is linear.
  $$
  f(x) = \begin{cases} 
            2x & \quad x<=2 \\
           
            -x+3 &  \quad x>2 
         \end{cases}
  $$
  For the linear EH model mentioned in this paper:
  $$
  EH_{i}^{D} = \begin{cases} 
            0 & \quad P_{i}^{R}\in[P^{0}_{tn},P^{1}_{th}] \\
            k_{j}P^{R}+b_{j},&\quad P_{i}^{R}\in[P_{th}^{j},P^{j+1}_{th}], j\in1,\dots,L-1\\
            P_{max}^{EH} &  \quad P_{i}^{R}\in[P_{th}^{L},P_{th}^{L+1}] 
         \end{cases}
  $$
  Where the $EH_{i}^{D}$ is the power harvested by D2D receiver i , and $P_{i}^{R}$ is the received power for EH at D2D receiver i when sharing the RB with CUE k, which can be expressed as:
  $$
  P_{i}^{R}=\lambda_{i}^{e}(P_{i}^{D}+P_{k}^{C}h_{k,i}+N_{0})
  $$
  Note that $P_{th}=\{P_{th}|1\leq j\leq L+1 \}$ is the set of thresholds on $P_{i}^{R}$ for $L+1$ linear segments. The $k_{j}$ and $b_{j}$ are the coefficients and the intercept of the linear function in the $j_{th}$ segment. $P_{th}^{1}$ denotes the minimum received power requirement for activating the **RF EH **circuit, which is also the circuit sensitivity of the EH circuit, and te $P_{max}^{EH}$ is the maximum power the **RF EH ** circuit can harvest. 

  So the above piecewise linear EH model shows  the different amount of energy that the system can harvest at different segment.

- **Maximization of energy efficiency(EE)for SWIPT-enabled D2D links**

  The final equation of **Energy Efficiency(EE)** for D2D links can be expressed by
  $$
  EE_{i}^{D}=\frac{T_{i}^{D}}{EC_{i}^{D}}=\frac{log_{2}(1+\frac{P_{i}^{D}h_{i}^{D}}{(P_{k}^{C}h_{k,i}+N_{0})+\frac{N_{1}}{1-\lambda_{i}^{e}}})}{P_{i}^{D}+2P_{cir}-EH_{i}^{D}}
  $$
  As shown in the equation, if i want to find the maximum value of the Energy Efficiency, it is all about finding a optimal value for the transmission power at D2D link i ($P_{i}^{D}$), the harvest energy from the system($EH_{i}^{D}$), the power splitting ratio($\lambda_{i}^{e}$). 

  And in this paper, the transmission power for **CUE link is constant for simulation**



- **non-linear programming**

  In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), **nonlinear programming** (**NLP**) is the process of solving an [optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem) where some of the constraints or the objective function are [nonlinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear)

  

- **linear programming:**

  Linear programming is a simple technique where we **depict** complex relationships through linear functions and then find the optimum points. The important word in the previous sentence is depicted. The real relationships might be much more complex – but we can simplify them to linear relationships.

  As shown in the figure 1, it is a very classic example for people to use LP to  save on fuel and time and find the shortest route.
