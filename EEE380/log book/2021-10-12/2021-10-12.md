Still working on the paper ***Resource and Power Allocation in SWIPT-Enabled Device-to-Device Communications Based on a Nonlinear Energy Harvesting Model***. Record some notes for the piecewise linear EH model mentioned in this paper, and methods for transforming the linear programming model into nonlinear programming model.

### Technical term

- **Piecewise linear functions**

  It is a  function whose graph consists of straight line segments. it is a function of which the each piecewise is linear.
  $$
  f(x) = \begin{cases} 
            2x & \quad x<=2 \\
           
            -x+3 &  \quad x>2 
         \end{cases}
  $$
  For the linear EH model mentioned in this paper:
  $$
  EH_{i}^{D} = \begin{cases} 
            0 & \quad P_{i}^{R}\in[P^{0}_{tn},P^{1}_{th}] \\
            k_{j}P^{R}+b_{j},&\quad P_{i}^{R}\in[P_{th}^{j},P^{j+1}_{th}], j\in1,\dots,L-1\\
            P_{max}^{EH} &  \quad P_{i}^{R}\in[P_{th}^{L},P_{th}^{L+1}] 
         \end{cases}
  $$
  Where the $EH_{i}^{D}$ is the power harvested by D2D receiver i , and $P_{i}^{R}$ is the received power for EH at D2D receiver i when sharing the RB with CUE k, which can be expressed as:
  $$
  P_{i}^{R}=\lambda_{i}^{e}(P_{i}^{D}+P_{k}^{C}h_{k,i}+N_{0})
  $$
  Note that $P_{th}=\{P_{th}|1\leq j\leq L+1 \}$ is the set of thresholds on $P_{i}^{R}$ for $L+1$ linear segments. The $k_{j}$ and $b_{j}$ are the coefficients and the intercept of the linear function in the $j_{th}$ segment. $P_{th}^{1}$ denotes the minimum received power requirement for activating the **RF EH **circuit, which is also the circuit sensitivity of the EH circuit, and te $P_{max}^{EH}$ is the maximum power the **RF EH ** circuit can harvest. 

  So the above piecewise linear EH model shows  the **different amount of energy that the system can harvest at different segment.**

- **Maximization of energy efficiency(EE)for SWIPT-enabled D2D links**

  The final equation of **Energy Efficiency(EE)** for D2D links can be expressed by
  $$
  EE_{i}^{D}=\frac{T_{i}^{D}}{EC_{i}^{D}}=\frac{log_{2}(1+\frac{P_{i}^{D}h_{i}^{D}}{(P_{k}^{C}h_{k,i}+N_{0})+\frac{N_{1}}{1-\lambda_{i}^{e}}})}{P_{i}^{D}+2P_{cir}-EH_{i}^{D}}
  $$
  As shown in the equation, if i want to find the maximum value of the Energy Efficiency, it is all about finding a optimal value for the transmission power at D2D link i ($P_{i}^{D}$), the harvest energy from the system($EH_{i}^{D}$), the power splitting ratio($\lambda_{i}^{e}$). 

  And in this paper, the transmission power for **CUE link is constant for simulation**。
  
  Accordingly, In this paper the EE maximization problem was formulated as

- **non-linear programming**

  In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), **nonlinear programming** (**NLP**) is the process of solving an [optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem) where some of the constraints or the objective function are [nonlinear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear)

  

- **linear programming:**

  Linear programming is a simple technique where we **depict** complex relationships through linear functions and then find the optimum points. The important word in the previous sentence is depicted. The real relationships might be much more complex – but we can simplify them to linear relationships.

  As shown in the figure 1, it is a very classic example for people to use LP to  save on fuel and time and find the shortest route.

### Notation definition

- $argmax_{S}f=\{x\in f(s) \quad for  \quad all\quad s\in S\}$:$argmax$ is the set of points $x$ for which $f(x)$ attains the function's largest value(if it exists). $Argmax$ may be the empty set, a singleton, or contain multiple elements.





### Literature Review

1. ***On nonlinear fractional programming*:**

   1. To figure out how did the authors transform a the nonconvex factional programming problem which is very difficult to solve into a nonfractional problem by employing nonlinear fractional programming.

      - Some mathematic concepts:

        - Compact space: In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), specifically [general topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_topology), **compactness** is a property that generalizes the notion of a subset of [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space) being [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set) (containing all its [limit points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_point)) and [bounded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_set) (having all its points lie within some fixed distance of each other).
        - Euclidean space: Euclidean space is the fundamental space of [classical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_geometry). Originally, it was the [three-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space) of [Euclidean geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry), but in modern [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) there are Euclidean spaces of any nonnegative integer [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(mathematics)),[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space#cite_note-FOOTNOTESolomentsev2001-1) including the three-dimensional space and the *Euclidean plane* (dimension two). 

      - First of all, we need to figure out the relationship between nonlinear fractional nonlinear parametric Programming:

        Let's set two different real-valued functions $N(x)$ and $D(x)$, they are all continuous. In addition, we also assumed that:$D(x)>0$ for all $x\in S$.

        To figure out the problems mentioned before, we need to think about two following questions:

        1. $max\{\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}|x\in S\}$
        2. $max\{N(x)-qD(x)|x\in S\}$ for $q\in E^{1}$ where $E^{1}$ is one dimensional Euclidean space

        According to Dickelbach, we have a couple of following Lemmas.

        - $Lemma$ *1*:$F(q)=max\{N(x)-qD(x)|x\in S\}$ is convex over$E^{1}$
        - $Lemma$ *2*:$F(q)$ is continuous for $q\in E^{1}$.
        - $Lemma$ *3*:$F(q)=max\{N(x)-qD(x)|x\in S\}$ is strictly monotonic decreasing.
        - $Lemma$ *4*:$F(q)=0$ has an unique solution, $q_{0}$
        - $Lemma$ *5*: Let $x^{+}\in S$ and $q^{+}=\frac{N(x^{+})}{D(x^{+})})$ then $F(q^{+})\geq 0$

        For any $q=q^{*}$, the maximum of $\{N(x)-q^{*}D(x)|x \in S\}$ is taken on, for instance at $x^{*}$; this may be indicated by writing $F(q^{*},x^{*})$. Now that we can get a theorem:
        $$
        q_{0}=\frac{N(x_{0})}{D(x_{0})}=max\{\frac{N(x)}{D(x)}|x\in S\} \quad if \quad and \quad only  \quad if,\\
        F(q_{0})=F(q_{0},x_{0})=max\{N(x)-q_{0}D(x)|x\in S\}=0
        $$
        Now, back to the problem, for the original equation we have:
        $$
        EE_{i}^{D}=\frac{T_{i}^{D}}{EC_{i}^{D}}
        $$
        This is the target of the whole paper we want to find the maximum value of the Energy efficiency. Now we can use the method that we deduced above:
        $$
        max\{T_{i}^{D}-Q_{i}^{D}EC_{i}^{D}\}, \quad i\in Eha^{D}
        $$
        Where in this method  $T_{i}^{D}$  and $EC_{i}^{D}$ is $N(x)$ and$D(x)$ respectively. And according to the nonlinear fractional programming method there is a $Q_{i}^{D}$ which can let the $F(T_{i}^{D},EC_{i}^{D})=0$.

      

Then remember that we have this equation and a couple constraints:

So according to the usage of Lagrange multipliers, C1-C6 can all be thought of as different constraints. And if you want to find the Maximum value of $EE_{i}^{D}$,  we can put them all into the Lagrange function:
$$
EE_{i}^{D}=T_{i}^{D}-Q_{i}^{D}EC_{i}^{D}-\alpha(P_{i}^{D}-P_{max})\\-\beta(\lambda_{i}^{e}-1)+\gamma(T_{i}^{D}-T_{min}^{D})+\delta(T_{i}^{C}-T_{min}^{C})+\in(P_{i}^{R}-P_{th}^{1})
$$
Where all of these symbols are Lagrange multipliers for C1-C5 respectively.
