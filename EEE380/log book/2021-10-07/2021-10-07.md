### Literature Review

#### 1.1 Before the final topic

According to suggestions from my supervisor professor Xiaoli, I need to pick one paper which is relevant to her current research area. Since I am always very interested in the combination of algorithm optimization and wireless communication, after a lot of literature review, I finally decided to work on a paper which proposed a prematching algorithm which can highly increase the sum energy efficiency in the SWIPT enabled cellular network. Before I decided to work on this paper, I also do a lot of literature review about combination of Machine learning and wireless communication, however they are not quite related to Professor's Xiaoli's current research area.



### 1.2 Understand basic idea

The paper *Resource and Power Allocation in SWIPT-Enabled Device-to-Device Communications Based on a Nonlinear Energy Harvesting Model* main goal is to **maximize the sum EE of all D2D links in a SWIPT-enabled D2D underlaid cellular network, where D2D links reuse uplink resources and a piecewise linear EH model1 is considered for SWIPT.**



#### 1.3 Some methods

- A special **prematching algorithm** to separate **SWIPT-enabled D2D links** and non-EH D2D links, then we maximize the EE of each potential SWIPT-enabled D2D link based on the prematching results
- **A special Iterative Algorithm** to solve the nonfractional problem
- **TLEEIAâ€”Inner Loop Iterative Algorithm** to obtain the optimal value of $\lambda_{i,j}^{e},P_{i,j}^{D},EE_{i,j}^{D}$ which is the **power splitting ratio**, **transmission power of D2D link**, **Energy Efficiency** respectively



#### 1.4 Glossary

- Cellular network:  A **cellular network** or **mobile network** is a [communication network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_network) where the link to and from end nodes is [wireless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless). The network is distributed over land areas called "cells", each served by at least one fixed-location [transceiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transceiver) (typically three [cell sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_site) or [base transceiver stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_transceiver_station)).

- SWIPT:  SWIPT is **a wireless communication technique through which** it is possible to receive information and harvest energy from a received signal, and the harvested energy can be utilized for relaying of information or processing purposes.

- **Device-to-Device (D2D)** communication in cellular networks is defined as direct communication between two mobile users without traversing the [Base Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station) (BS) or [core network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_network).

- user-equipment: like mobile phone, lap top etc..

- Resource block: In 5G, One NR Resource Block (RB) **contains 12 sub-carriers in frequency domain similar to LTE**. 

- circuit sensitivity: A simple definition of circuit sensitivity is **how much a circuit characteristic changes when a component value is different**.
