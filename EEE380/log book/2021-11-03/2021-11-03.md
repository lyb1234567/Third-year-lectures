From this algorithm, we can get the optimal value of the transmission power of D2D links $P_{i}^{D}$, power slitting ratio$\lambda_{i}^{e}$ and Energy efficiency $EE_{i,j}D$.

Since we want to solve the equations $\max_{P_{i}^{D},\lambda_{i}^{e}}$ $T_{i}^{D}-Q_{i}^{D}EC_{i}^{D},i\in Eha^{D}$. we need to find the optimal values of $T^{D*}_{i}$ and optimal value of total energy consumption $EC_{i}^{D}=P_{i}^{D}+2P_{cir}-EH_{i}^{D}$. And the equation can be reached only when  two optimal values are found.

### Gradient Descent

For a given the sum of squared residual function as loss function:
$$
Q=\sum_{1}^{n}(y_{i}-(ax_{i}+b))^2
$$
We can see that we have two unknown variable which can be used to optimize the loss function. To find the optimal values of them we need to get the derivative with respect to a and b:
$$
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial b}=-2\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-b-ax_{i})\\
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial a}=-2a\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-b-ax_{i})x_{i}
$$
Remember we need to initialize the learning rate and corresponding parameters( in this case: a and b)

Then we will get the first derivative with respect to a and b. And multiply them by the learning rate we set. Then the obtained value is what we call the step size.
$$
s=slope*learning \quad rate
$$
And the new parameters( in this case a and b ) would be the old parameters minus the obtained step size.



In the reference paper:

We need to find 5 different parameters which are also the optimal Lagrange multipliers we are looking for:
$$
\begin{align*}
&\alpha=\{\alpha+s_{1}(P_{i}^{D}-P_{max})\}^{+}\\
&\beta=\{\beta+s_{2}(\lambda_{i}^{e}-1)\}^{+}\\
&\gamma=\{\gamma-s_{3}(T_{i}^{D}-T_{min}^{D})\}^{+}\\
&\delta=\{\delta-s_{4}(T_{k}^{C}-T_{min}^{C})\}^{+}\\
&\in=\{\in-s_{5}(P_{i}^{R}-P_{th}^{1})\}^{+}
\end{align*}
$$
Following the instructions mentioned above, for example we want to find the optimal value of $\alpha$
