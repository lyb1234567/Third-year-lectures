The PFMR is confusing, since it didn't quite go down when then number of D2D links goes up as expected. I think it is due to the fact that the distance parameter I chose from the CUE k and D2D link i is wrong, also, I think the generation of the rayleigh channel coefficient is a a bit weird, which needs to be figured out later.
