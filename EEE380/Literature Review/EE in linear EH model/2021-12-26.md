***2.Energy-Efficient Stable Matching for Resource Allocation in Energy Harvesting-Based Device-to-Device Communications***

When it comes to EE improvement using EH in D2D network, resource allocation  is a very important problem which refer to optimize the utilization of different types of  source in the communication system such as power, frequency and time. In [1] , the power resource allocation problem has been solved by generating a  power allocation model using game theory with the utility defined for each SWIPT-Enabled D2D link, and the power was increased in each D2D link with this power source allocation scheme according to their results hence reach the goal of improving EE. In [2], to solve the resource  allocation problem,it was first formulated to an optimization problem with power and spectrum resource reusing constraints, then a stable matching algorithm based on EH model was proposed to address it and the average energy efficiency was increased with this algorithm.

However, although the work above did improve energy efficiency using SWIPT, the EH model they use is just a simplified linear model which where the harvested energy is linearly proportional to the input RF energy.
