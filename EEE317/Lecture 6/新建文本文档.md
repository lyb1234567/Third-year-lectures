### Energy density reduction

### Jamming

- Strong signal over a narrow bandwidth
- small signal over a wide bandwidth(it is similar to AWGN)



If we have a strong Jamming signal in our g(t), the jamming signal will be added to the g(t) at the receiver and will be multiplied by PN code to de spreaded.

So the g(t) will be despreaded, and thus we will get the original m(t) while the jamming signal will be spreaded .
